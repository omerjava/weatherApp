# WeatherApp

## About Project

By using [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) public Api, I have developed a simple Weather Application with Angular and Bootstrap.
Via this app:
 - You can follow weather info of 9 Belgium cities: Antwerp, Brusssels, Brugge, Charleroi, Hasselt, Leuven, Ghent, Liege, Namur.
 - You can know temperature of today (now) and max and min temperatures of next 7 days.
 - According to weather situation background photo and weather icons change.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
